  <h1>Ecosystem</h1>
  <p>An ecosystem is a community of living organisms and their physical environment that interact with each other: <br>
    <ol><li>Living components: Plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms </li>
   <li> Non-living components: Sunlight, water, air, temperature, oxygen, and soil</li> 
    <li>Energy flow: Energy flows through the system, usually from light to heat </li>
    <li>Matter recycling: Matter is recycled within the ecosystem </li>
    <li>Ecosystems can be natural or artificial, and can be found on land or in water. Examples of artificial ecosystems include gardens, parks, aquariums, and croplands. </li>
    <li>The word ecosystem comes from the Greek words oikos, meaning "home," and systema, meaning "system". The term was proposed by British botanist Arthur Tansley. </li></ol>
    Here are some other things to know about ecosystems: 
    <ul><li>Ecosystems can be of different sizes. Large ecosystems are often called biomes.</li> 
    <li>Ecosystems with higher biodiversity are more stable and resilient to disturbances.</li> 
    <li>Introducing new species or environmental factors can lead to the collapse of an ecosystem. </li>
    <li>The term "ecosystem" has been used in many contexts outside of the natural environment, such as "app ecosystem" and "education ecosystem".</li></ul> </p>
